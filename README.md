# Computational-Group-Theory
My Master's project. Not the final version, but the structure, classes and methods should be clear.

The Graph and Vertex classes were in the geometry package, the purpose of which was to describe graphs. The GraphResolver class was in the resolver package, the purpose of which was to provide a tool for simplifying graphs. The rest of the classes were in the algebra package, the purpose of which was to represent rational polynomials (though the code is general enough to be useful for other things as well).
